 Clock Using C++

This mini project showcases a basic digital clock built using C++. It runs in the console and updates time in real-time, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds.

 Project Contents

- `Clock_Using_C++.pdf` â€“ Contains the complete source code and explanation of the project.

 Technologies Used

- C++  
- Console I/O  
- Time functions (`<ctime>`, `<windows.h>`)

 How It Works

The clock uses system time functions to fetch the current time and displays it in a loop with a delay, simulating a ticking clock. The logic is written in C++ and explained step-by-step in the PDF.

 How to Use

1. Open the `Clock_Using_C++.pdf` file.
2. Copy the code into your C++ IDE or editor.
3. Compile and run the code to see the clock in action.
